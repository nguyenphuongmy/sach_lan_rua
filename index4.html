        <h5 class="card-title">The Puppet</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The Puppet (also known as the Marionette) is an animatronic puppet, a major antagonist, and one of the toy animatronics of the Five Nights at Freddy's series, first appearing in Five Nights at Freddy's 2, but later games show its heroic side. It possibly serves as the prize vendor of the newly refurbished Freddy Fazbear's Pizza of 1987, although it's implied that it was originally from Fredbear's Family Diner.

The Puppet was haunted by William Afton's first victim, a little girl named Charlotte Emily, who was the daughter of Henry Emily. However, during the completion ending, the Puppet's soul was presumably set free.</p>
