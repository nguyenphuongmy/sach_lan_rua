        <h5 class="card-title">Five Nights at Freddy's</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Five Nights at Freddy's is an indie point-and-click survival horror video game and the first installment of the series developed by Scott Cawthon. It was first released on Desura on August 8, 2014 (although it was ultimately removed at an unknown date), and released on Steam on August 18, 2014. The goal for the player is to survive five nights at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza while avoiding getting caught and stuffed into a mascot costume, thus getting killed by the animatronic characters; this is done by tracking their movements via the restaurant's security cameras.

Due to its universal success upon release, the game spawned a media franchise for a series of games, books, etc.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Five Nights at Freddy's 2</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is the second game in the series, chronologically thought to be a sequel to Five Nights at Freddy's 4, and the prequel to Five Nights at Freddy's. The game takes place in November, 1987. Five Nights at Freddy's 2 was released on November 11, 2014, on Steam and Desura for $7.99. There is also a free demo on IndieDB. The game was supposed to be released sometime in 2015, as seen on a poster on Scott Cawthon's website, but it was changed due to problems in releasing the demo.

It was released on Steam and Desura on November 10, 2014, after a delay with the demo. A mobile port for Android was released on November 13, 2014, and an iOS port on November 20, 2014</p>

        <p class="card-text">Five Nights at Freddy's 3 is an indie point-and-click survival horror video game and the third installment of the series developed by Scott Cawthon. It is chronologically the fourth game of the series, and the sequel to Five Nights at Freddy's set thirty years after the events of the first game.

There are no doors or lights in the third game, and the player must rely on playing audio and sealing off vents to survive, as well as utilizing a Maintenance Panel to reboot any systems which happen to go offline.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Five Nights at Freddy's 4</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Five Nights at Freddy's 4, originally named Five Nights at Freddy's: The Final Chapter in development, is an indie point-and-click survival horror game developed by Scott Cawthon, and the fourth installment of the Five Nights at Freddy's series. The game is a prequel to Five Nights at Freddy's 2, and takes place in 1983, chronologically being the first game in the series.[1]

The fourth game deviates from previous games in many ways - instead of having a Monitor to ward away animatronics, the player must instead check the Doors, Closet, and the Bed and utilize a Flashlight and doors to ward away any nightmare animatronics outside of the Bedroom.</p>
